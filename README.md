> Split a multi-layer exr image into multiple files

About .exr
-----
.exr files are very useful, with a high compression, support for high quality and multiple layers. However, many programs don't support loading multi-layer, only files with the standard 3 or 4 color channels. This program uses the OpenEXR python implementation to split a multi-layer exr image into many exr images. The output may be either single channel (with 3-4 images for each layer) or RGB/RGBA and the program supports conversion to png using imagemagick.
